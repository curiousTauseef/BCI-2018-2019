# BCI-2018-2019
The BCI team's project for the 2019 NeurotechX Competition. 
  
This years project will attempt to use concentration as a control for various games. The current goal is to create a binary concentration classifier to control a game where a balloon wedged between spikes above it, and a fan below it. The balloon naturally rises towards the spikes when the user is not concentrating due to the fan. The user can move the balloon downards at a fixed rate by concentrating.
  
Several Stretch Goals include:  
* Classify concentration as a gradient, and create a PVP wizard duel game  
* Incorporate both blinking and concentration into a wizard duel in the above wizard duel game
